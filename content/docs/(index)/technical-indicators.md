- **Bad signal**: Shifting periods (choppy, ranging market)
- **Use case**: Parameter optimization, cycle strength assessment

#### 🔄 HTDCPHASE - Hilbert Transform Dominant Cycle Phase
- **What**: Position within dominant cycle
- **Why it matters**: Timing indicator for cycle-based entries/exits
- **Good signal**: Phase at lows (bounce setup), rising phase (uptrend continuation)
- **Bad signal**: Phase at highs (pullback risk), phase unreliable in non-cyclic markets
- **Use case**: Precise entry/exit timing, cycle-based systems

#### 🎯 HTTRENDMODE - Hilbert Transform Trend vs Cycle
- **What**: Binary indicator (trending vs cycling mode)
- **Why it matters**: Tells you which strategy to use (trend-following vs oscillator)
- **Good signal**: TRENDING mode = use trend-following strategies, Bollinger Bands, MACD
- **Bad signal**: CYCLING mode = avoid trend-following, use mean-reversion oscillators
- **Use case**: Strategy mode selection, adaptive trading systems

### 📍 Additional Oscillators

#### 🟣 ROCR - Rate of Change Ratio
- **What**: Ratio form of ROC rather than percentage
- **Why it matters**: Alternative calculation method for ROC analysis
- **Good signal**: ROCR > 1 (price up), rising (acceleration)
- **Bad signal**: ROCR < 1 (price down), falling (deceleration)
- **Use case**: Ratio-based momentum, mathematical alternatives

#### 📊 MIDPOINT / MIDPRICE
- **What**: Average of recent highs and lows (or close prices)
- **Why it matters**: Shows center price range for equilibrium levels
- **Good signal**: Price above midpoint (bullish bias), below midpoint (bearish bias)
- **Bad signal**: Price oscillating around midpoint (balanced, no edge)
- **Use case**: Center line identification, mean-reversion levels
